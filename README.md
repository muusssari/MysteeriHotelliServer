# GameBox
Little multiplayer games with friends (for learning)


to start the server:
node app.js
then go localhost:2000

coming/known issues
- logging system?
- Add events (random jumps, etc) in maze game
- add better tutorial
- add chat to lobby and lobby creating (type, name, max players, game)
- remove lobbies / maybe rebooting?
- lobby types for different kind of games

- better visual
- favicon
- sound effects

- clean code and make more module
 -> module games in client
 -> server sending data

- more games?!?
